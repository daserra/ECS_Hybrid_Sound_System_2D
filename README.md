# ECS_Hybrid_Sound_System_2D

How it works : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ztDeFGbuYYU

This is a simple example how use unity ECS to create a sound system for 2D Games. 

Sound System:
- Set the volume and stereo pan based on player position.
- Flexible and simple audio source configuration with radius of range and max volume.

### Installation
Just clone this repository folder and open it in Unity.


### Future Upates

I intend to add a few new features to this system such:
  - Trigger System to stop and start the audio whenever you want.
  - Collisiom System, for example, if there is a wall in the audio area, behind the wall the sound volume should be decreased.
